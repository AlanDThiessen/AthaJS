# AthaJS
AthaJS is a cloud-based framework for complete home automation built using [FeathersJS].

Atha allows "Home Owners" to define houses with zones (e.g. "Living Room", "Upstairs", "Back Yard") and add controlled devices to each zone.  Home owners can create users and groups, setting permissions for which user/group can view and control the various devices.

AthaJS provides the primary server as well as the web client for managing the homes.  [AthaMobile](https://github.com/AlanDThiessen/AthaMobile) is the mobile application for controlling the various devices.  Other FeathersJS-based clients can be easily added.
